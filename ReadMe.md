# Learning To Paint with RL

This problem aims at training an agent to generate paintings using stroke based sequential actions. We plan to break down the given target image into a set number of strokes, using a RL agent, which can generate a painted image. Compare On Policy (PPO) and Off Policy (DDPG) methods for solving the problem. We also aim at incorporating style transfer while painting.
